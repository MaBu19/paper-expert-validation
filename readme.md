# Data organization 
The scripts s0-s9 document the automatic sorting of raw data to files needed for the analyses.

The folder "Datasets" includes model-predicted and expert-validated CAFPAs as used for different analysis steps. Data from audiological measurements (real patient data) is not contained. 

Note the data availability statement: The data analyzed in this study is subject to the following licenses/restrictions: According to the data usage agreement of the authors, the datasets analyzed in this study can only be shared upon motivated request. Requests to access these datasets should be directed to Mareike Buhl, mareike.buhl@uni-oldenburg.de, Andrea Hildebrandt, andrea.hildebrandt@uni-oldenburg.de. 



# Analysis 
The analysis is structured in three files: 

- a1 performs the analyses for research questions RQ1 and RQ2 (to be run in R)
- a2 performs the analyses for research question RQ3 (to be run in Matlab) 
- a3 plots Supplementary Figure A5 (CAFPA density, to be run in R)
